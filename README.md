# CSCE_315_Lab
Personal website

  As of 01/31/2020, this website is just the draft of the final. A lot of my content is missing (About me section, details about projects, service, and qualifications), but so far 
I'm just trying to get the mechanics/functionality of the site down. This includes the navigation bar, footer, and basic CSS styling/formatting. Please don't judge too harshly :).

TODO: 1) Add sections for each 'body' page to better read the content of the page. 
      2) Add all missing content
      3) Explore ways to list projects/experience in a presentable way (perhaps cards?)
      4) Fix design, make it look better
